TOPIC : IoT Sensor Data Analytics Pipeline using Kafka, AWS Glue, DMS, Kinesis, S3, ClickHouse, Hive, and PySpark. 

Use-Case :
Vehicle Health Monitoring & Predictive Maintenance
Problem: Unexpected vehicle breakdowns cost businesses money and lead to downtime.

Solution: 
Build a Glue pipeline that processes RPM, engine load, coolant temp (cTemp), and DTC codes in real-time to:
Detect early signs of engine trouble.
Trigger alerts for overheating, frequent high RPMs, low battery, or high eLoad.

Pipeline Outcome:
Alerting system on anomalies
Maintenance recommendations
Aggregated health reports in ClickHouse for dashboards
